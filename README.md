Sign Language Recognition with Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for sign language recognition using the Mediapipe library and a combination of LSTM and Dense layers. The model leverages the power of deep learning to analyze sign language gestures captured by a camera or other input devices, and accurately classify them into corresponding actions or classes.

Key Features:
- Utilizes Mediapipe solutions for holistic hand and body pose estimation.
- Implements a sequential model using Keras or TensorFlow, consisting of LSTM and Dense layers.
- Accepts input data representing a sequence of frames, with each frame containing multiple keypoints.
- Trains the model to learn the spatial and temporal patterns in sign language gestures.
- Supports real-time or offline recognition of sign language gestures.
- Provides a graphical representation of the confusion matrix and accuracy for evaluation.

This project can be used as a foundation for various applications, such as sign language translation systems, interactive sign language learning tools, or assistive technologies for individuals with hearing impairments.

Dependencies:
- mediapipe: a powerful library for real-time perception tasks, including hand and body pose estimation.
- tensorflow or keras: deep learning frameworks for building and training the machine learning model.

Instructions:
1. Prepare your dataset of sign language gestures, ensuring each gesture is labeled with the corresponding action.
2. Use the Mediapipe library to extract hand and body keypoints from the input data.
3. Create a sequential model in Keras or TensorFlow, combining LSTM and Dense layers.
4. Train the model using your labeled dataset, optimizing its performance.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like the confusion matrix and accuracy.
6. Utilize the trained model to recognize sign language gestures in real-time or offline scenarios.

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the model architecture, incorporating other deep learning techniques, or expanding its capabilities. Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome!

Let's bridge the gap between sign language and technology with the power of machine learning.
